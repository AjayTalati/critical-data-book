## Summary of Publication

In this chapter, we use a case study conducted using the MIMIC-II database, “Efficacy of Rate Control Medications in Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (Afib with RVR) amongst Critically Ill Patients”, as an example to demonstrate the concepts of propensity score analysis in EHR data research. In this study we investigated which of the three most commonly used rate control agents performed best as a sole agent to reach rate control for patients with Afib with RVR.
