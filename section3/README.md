# Section 3: Case Studies

## Summary

This section presents twelve case studies of secondary analyses of electronic health records. The case studies cover a range of research areas: from analysis of organisational change over a period of years to assessment of the clinical effectiveness of specific interventions; from prediction of patient outcomes to continuous estimation of physiological parameters. The range of methodologies demonstrated is no less broad: from machine learning techniques to propensity score matching; from natural language processing to physiological signal processing. Approaches to commonly encountered hurdles such as patient cohort identification and outcome extraction are illustrated on publicly available data, with analytical code supplied. Consequently, the case studies form a valuable resource for clinicians and data scientists, beginners and experts alike.

## Contents

The code used in this section of the book is provided to allow users to replicate the case studies. You may wish to focus on those case studies which are written in the programming language(s) with which you are most familiar. Here are the programming languages used in each of the case studies:
