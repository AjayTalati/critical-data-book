# Chapter 27. Signal processing: False Alarm Reduction

This directory contains the code used in the following publication:

Li Q. and Clifford G., **Signal processing: False Alarm Reduction*, Springer, [Under Review]

Code _is not provided at present_.

## Summary of Publication

Modern patient monitoring systems in intensive care produce frequent false alarms that can lead to reduced standard of care. In this case study we demonstrate the development of an algorithm which uses a data fusion and machine learning approach to reduce the number of false alarms, while avoiding the suppression of a significant number of true alarms.
