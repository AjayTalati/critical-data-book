# Chapter 20. Mortality prediction in the ICU based on MIMIC-II: Results from the Super ICU Learner Algorithm (SICULA) project

This directory contains the code used in the following publication:

Pirracchio R. **Mortality prediction in the ICU based on MIMIC-II: Results from the Super ICU Learner Algorithm (SICULA) project**, in *Secondary analysis of Electronic Health Record Data*, Springer, [Under Review]

Code is provided in R format.

## Summary of Publication

MIMIC II dataset offers a unique opportunity to develop and validate new severity scores. Non-parametric approaches are needed to model ICU mortality. Prediction of hospital mortality based on the Super Learner achieves significantly improved performance, both in terms of calibration and discrimination, as compared to conventional severity scores.

## Replicating this Publication

*This case study used code from the Super Learner Library, implemented in R.*
