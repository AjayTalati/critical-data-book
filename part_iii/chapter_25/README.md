## Summary of Publication

This chapter describes two different approachesâ€”a case-control and a case-crossover design--to examine the effect of transient exposure of hypotension on the risk of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.  We highlight the key differences and the design rationale of these two approaches, and present preliminary findings from applying these techniques to study the relationship between hypotension and AKI using the MIMIC II database.
