# Rmarkdown files

These are the Rmarkdown (.Rmd) files used to generate the book subchapters.  They can be run using RStudio.  You likely will have to run the code chunk-by-chunk, and some may not currently work.


Note: You should download the `full_cohort_data.csv` into the same directory where you plan to run this code to ensure it runs.  See Chapter 5a for details of how to get access to the data.
