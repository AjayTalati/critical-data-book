# R code

This is the R code for Chapter 5.  Some code is commented out, as it's there for book presentation purposes only.  I would encourage you to use the Rmd files if possible.

 
Note: You should download the `full_cohort_data.csv` into the same directory where you plan to run this code to ensure it runs.  See Chapter 5a for details of how to get access to the data.
