# Chapter 16. Data Analysis

Authors: Jesse D. Raffa, Marzyeh Ghassemi, Tristan Naumann, Mengling Feng and Douglas Hsu

We have included code in the form of `R` markdown files (.Rmd) that can be run via RStudio.  For those wishing to use a Jupyter notebook instead, we have included experimental .ipynb files which can be run after installing the R kernel for Jupyter.  Both Rstudio and Jupyter are freely available.  For more details, see the links below.

R (needed for all code to run): https://cran.r-project.org/
